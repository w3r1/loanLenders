Challenge
- Determining how monthly compounding interest is calculated.
- Timeboxed approach of 4 hours, missing tests due to time

Tests
Missing tests through timeboxed approach. Tests which should me done are:
- Integration test, more specific end-to-end functional tests with expected results on base of a static csv
- Module tests, more specific unit tests of each class
- Frameworks: Spock for writing nice readable BDD tests

How to run
- mvn package
- java -jar ./target/loanlenders-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar ./src/test/resource/MarketData.csv 1000
